Roadmap

## Next steps

- Login Features: In the upcoming releases, I am planning to introduce user login functionality, allowing personal galleries and saved artworks.
- Custom AI Model: Currently,I am leveraging an open-source AI model for image generation. My future goal is to build and train my own model to provide unique and customized art experiences for users.
- Also need to update the **Example Prompts** page to contain some of the best prompts for image generations.
